	<h2>Sound/Cycle</h2>
	<h3>Summary</h3>
		<p style="text-align: left;">6 Oscillators with hard sync; bipolar 10v pp outputs.  All slopes are free-running, cycling up & down at rates defined by <em>TIME</em> & <em>INTONE</em>.</p>
		<h3>Controls</h3>
		<p style="text-align: left;">
			<b>TIME</b>: Controls the frequency of <em>IDENTITY</em>'s oscillation.<br>
			<br>
			<b>INTONE</b>: Sets harmonic ratios with unison and raw detuned <em>MIX</em>es near noon.  At noon, all periods are equal to <em>IDENTITY</em>'s.  Clockwise spreads upward through unjust chords, approaching the harmonic series (integer frequency multiples) in the extreme.  Inversely the undertone series (integer frequency divisions) is reached fully CCW.<br>
			<br>
			<b>FM Input + Attenuverter</b>: AC-coupled (digitally). CW provides linear FM of all oscillations in equal amounts. Turning CCW towards <em>INTONE</em> allows provides linear modulation in amounts accourding to <em>OUT</em> names.  Thus <em>IDENTITY</em> is unaffected, while <em>6N</em> is heavily modulated. When using the <em>MIX</em> output, this method retains the fundamental frequency while shaping the highs intensely.<br>
			<br>
			<b>RAMP</b>: Skews slopes from sawtooth, through asymetrical triangles to ramp waves.  Like <em>MANGROVE</em>'s barrel, the overall <em>TIME</em> is maintained, while blending the shape (sets the ratio of rise to fall time without adjusting total duration).<br>
			<br>
			<b>CURVE</b>: Blends the slopes from default linear gradients at 12:00.  CW passes through lazy 'log' shapes, and reaches cosines at the extreme.  CCW twists to snappy 'expo' curves then slides through trapezoids and into squares (with pulsewidth set by <em>RAMP</em>).<br>
			<br>
			<b>TRIGGERS</b>: Normalized from right to left, a <em>TRIGGER</em> in the rightmost will apply to all six.  Any slope that receives a <em>TRIGGER</em> immediately restarts its cycle immediately at the start of its attack phase.  <em>TRIGGER</em>ing only 6N will synchronize all channels due to their normalization.<br>
			<br>
		</p>
		<h3>Outputs</h3>
		<p style="text-align: left;">
			<b>INDIVIDUAL OUTS</b> are 10v pp bipolar oscillations.<br>
			<br>			
			<b>MIX</b> provides a combination of all active slopes. A musically balanced sum is output, floating around 10v pp.<br>
