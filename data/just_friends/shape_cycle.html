	  <h2>Shape/Cycle</h2>

		<h3>Summary</h3>
		<p style="text-align: left;">6 LFOs with reset triggers; 0-8v outputs.  All slopes are free-running, cycling up & down at rates defined by <em>TIME</em> & <em>INTONE</em>.</p>
		<h3>Controls</h3>
		<p style="text-align: left;">
			<b>TIME</b>: Controls the period of <em>IDENTITY</em>'s cycle.<br>
			<br>
			<b>INTONE</b>: Defines tempic relationships of each generator by controlling the ratio of each of <em>2N</em> through <em>6N</em>'s period to </em>IDENTITY</em>'s.  At noon, all periods are equal to <em>IDENTITY</em>'s.  Clockwise accelerates each of <em>2N</em> through <em>6N</em> towards integer multiples as defined by their labels, vs elongation into integer divisions counterclockwise.<br>
			<br>
			<b>FM Input + Attenuverter</b>: Turning CCW towards <em>INTONE</em> allows attenuated modulation of <em>INTONE</em>.  Turn clockwise to allow attenuated linear FM.  With nothing patched, there is a positive offset (digitally) normalled, allowing detune control CW and additional <em>INTONE</em> control CCW. To ensure accuracy of the <em>INTONE</em> pot, set <em>FM</em> to 12:00.<br>
			<br>
			<b>RAMP</b>: Skews slopes from sawtooth, through asymetrical triangles to ramp waves.  Like <em>MANGROVE</em>'s barrel, the overall <em>TIME</em> is maintained, while blending the shape (sets the ratio of rise to fall time without adjusting total duration).<br>
			<br>
			<b>CURVE</b>: Blends the slopes from default linear gradients at 12:00.  CW passes through lazy 'log' shapes, and reaches cosines at the extreme.  CCW twists to snappy 'expo' curves then slides through trapezoids and into squares (with pulsewidth set by <em>RAMP</em>).<br>
			<br>
			<b>TRIGGERS</b>: Normalized from right to left, a <em>TRIGGER</em> in the rightmost will apply to all six.  Any slope that receives a <em>TRIGGER</em> immediately restarts its cycle immediately at the start of its attack phase.  <em>TRIGGER</em>ing only 6N will synchronize all channels due to their normalization.<br>
			<br>
		</p>
		<h3>Outputs</h3>
		<p style="text-align: left;">
			<b>INDIVIDUAL OUTS</b> are 0-8v unipolar LFOs.<br>
			<br>			
			<b>MIX</b> provides a combination of all active slopes.  After dividing each slope by its <em>OUT</em> number, the maximum value is output.<br>
