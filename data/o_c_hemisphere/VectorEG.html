    <div class="content"><p>VectorEG is a dual envelope generator based on Vector Oscillator waveforms. There is a variety of built-in waveforms from which to choose, or you can create your own with the <a href="https://github.com/Chysn/O_C-HemisphereSuite/wiki/Waveform-Editor">Waveform Editor</a>.</p>

<h2>Controls</h2>

<ul>
<li>Digital Ins: A gate at each input starts and sustains the corresponding EG.</li>
<li>Outputs: Output A/C is the signal for EG 1, and Output B/D is the signal for EG 2</li>
<li>Encoders: Push to alternate the cursor between EG 1 frequency, EG 1 waveform select, EG 2 frequency and EG 2 waveform select.</li>
</ul>

<p>The EG runs freely until it gets to the second-to-last segment, and sustains at that point. When released, it proceeds to the level of the final segment at the speed specified by the final segment.</p>

<p>Unlike a traditional envelope generator, the speed of the envelope is determined with a single frequency control. The higher the frequency, the faster the envelope will run.</p>

<p>The outputs are uni-polar, and with positive offset, so that a level of -128 in the Waveform Editor corresponds to 0V, and a level of 127 is 5V.</p>

<p>VectorEG is in Hemisphere Suite starting with v1.6.</p>
