    <div class="content"><p>Like twenty years ago, I owned a Kurzweil K2000. It had what we call today--but didn&#39;t call back then--an Easter Egg. It was a Pong game that you could play from the panel, and it generated MIDI notes when the ball bounced off a wall.</p>

<p>This is the Pong we all know and love, with a few twists. As a ball bounces its way across the screen, the player defends the left side of the screen with a &quot;paddle,&quot; and the module defends the right side. It&#39;s an unfair game, though, because the module can&#39;t lose. As you return the ball and level up, the ball gets faster, and your paddle gets smaller and closer to your opponent. The odds are not in your favor!</p>

<h2>Controls</h2>

<ul>
<li>Up/Down Buttons: Move the paddle up and down. This is really to illustrate the use of the buttons&#39; event handler, and you really don&#39;t want to play the game with these things.</li>
<li>Encoders: Both encoders move the paddle up and down.</li>
<li>CV Input 1: Negative values move the paddle up, and positive values move the paddle down. There&#39;s a &quot;center detent,&quot; a small range that doesn&#39;t move the paddle at all. This is to compensate for noise that gets into the ADC.</li>
<li>Output A: When the ball bounces off your paddle, a short 5V trigger is sent to Output A.</li>
<li>Output B: When the ball bounces off anything else, a short 5V trigger is sent to Output B.</li>
<li>Output C: Sends 0 to 4-ish volts, based on the Y position of the ball. 0V is the top of the screen.</li>
<li>Output D: Sends 0 to 4-ish volts, based on the Y position of the player paddle. 0V is the top of the screen.</li>
</ul>
