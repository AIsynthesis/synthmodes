    <div class="content"><p>Vector LFO is a dual low-frequency oscillator based on Vector Oscillator waveforms. There is a variety of built-in waveforms from which to choose, or you can create your own with the <a href="https://github.com/Chysn/O_C-HemisphereSuite/wiki/Waveform-Editor">Waveform Editor</a>.</p>

<h2>Controls</h2>

<ul>
<li>Digital Ins: A trigger at each channel syncs the corresponding LFO</li>
<li>CV Ins: CV 1 is bi-polar modulation of the frequency of LFO 1. CV2 is attenuation of the amount of LFO 1 that&#39;s fed into Output B/D.</li>
<li>Outputs: Output A/C is the signal for LFO 1. Output B/D is the signal for LFO 2 mixed with the signal for LFO 1, with the mix based on the input to CV 2.</li>
<li>Encoders: Push to alternate the cursor between LFO 1 frequency, LFO 1 waveform select, LFO 2 frequency and LFO 2 waveform select.</li>
</ul>

<p>The LFO range is from .10Hz to 999Hz.</p>

<h2>Output A/C and LFO 1</h2>

<p>Output A/C is a the output of only LFO 1. LFO 1 can be synchronized with an external clock at Digital 1, and its frequency can be modulated over a 30Hz bi-polar range with CV 1.</p>

<h2>Output B/D and LFO 2</h2>

<p>Output B/D is a mixed output. By default, it is a 50%/50% mix of LFO 1 and LFO 2. Increasing voltage to CV 2 causes increasing attenuation of the LFO 1 signal. At 5V, the LFO 1 signal will be absent at Output B/D.</p>

<h2>Manual Oscillator Reset</h2>

<p>When a new waveshape is selected from the panel, both LFO 1 and LFO 2 will be reset to the beginning of their respective cycles.</p>

<p>VectorLFO is in Hemisphere Suite starting with v1.6.</p>
