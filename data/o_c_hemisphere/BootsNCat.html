    <div class="content"><p>Boots &#39;n Cats (BootsNCat) is a simple bass/snare drum synthesizer with stereo audio outputs.</p>

<h2>Controls</h2>

<ul>
<li>Digital Ins: Triggers, where Digital 1 fires the bass drum, and Digital 2 fires the snare drum</li>
<li>CV Ins: Attenuation Levels, where CV 1 attenuates the bass drum, and CV 2 attenuates the snare drum</li>
<li>Outputs: Audio outputs, where A/C is the bass drum output and B/D is the snare drum output, but see <strong>Blend</strong> below</li>
<li>Encoder: Sets Tone and Decay for drums, and Blend</li>
</ul>

<h2>Tone</h2>

<p>Each drum has a Tone control that sets the basic sound of the drum. For the bass drum, Tone controls the frequency, with higher values indicating a higher frequency. For the snare drum, the Tone control is more like a low-pass filter, with high values indicating a higher cutoff frequency.</p>

<h2>Decay</h2>

<p>Each drum has a Decay control that sets the decay of the drum between about 1/10 of a second and 1 second, with higher values indicating longer decay.</p>

<h2>Blend</h2>

<p>At a Blend level of 0, the bass drum and snare drum are totally isolated on Outputs A/C and B/D, respectively. As the Blend is increased, some of the signal from the opposite channel will be fed into each channel. A Blend level of 63 results in a 50/50 mix on both outputs.</p>

<p>Boots &#39;n Cats is available in Hemisphere Suite starting with V1.6.</p>
