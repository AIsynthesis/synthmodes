<p>Dual Quantizer converts CV input to pitches of specific musical scales.</p>

<h2>Controls</h2>

<ul>
<li>Digital Ins: Clock for each channel</li>
<li>CV Ins: Unquantized CV for each channel</li>
<li>Outputs: Quantized CV for each channel</li>
<li>Encoder Push: Alternate cursor between Channel 1 and Channel 2</li>
<li>Encoder Turn: Select scale and reset channel to continuous operation</li>
</ul>

<p>Each channel begins in continuous operation. That is, the incoming CV is quantized at a rate of about 16667 times per second. This might result in undesirable slippage between notes, so clocked operation is available on a per-channel basis.</p>

<p>To enter clocked operation, send a clock signal to a digital input. A clock icon will appear next to the selector for the corresponding channel to indicate that that quantizer is in clocked mode.</p>

<p>To return to continuous operation, stop sending clock to the channel, and then change the scale. As long as no additional clock signals are received at the channel, the quantizer will remain in continuous operation.</p>
