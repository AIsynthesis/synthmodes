    <div class="content"><p><em>Palimpsest</em> is an accent sequencer that composes a pattern by way of a repeated sequence of trigger impressions.</p>

<h2>Controls</h2>

<ul>
<li>Digital Ins: Clock to Digital 1 advances the sequence step. Digital 2 is the &quot;Brush&quot; input.</li>
<li>CV Ins: CV 1 modulates Decompose, and CV 2 modulates Compose</li>
<li>CV Outs: A/C is the accent output, and B/D is a trigger output sent when the level of the composed step is around 3V</li>
<li>Encoder Push: Moves cursor between Compose, Decompose, and Length settings</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Palimpsest</em> for Ornament and Crime is a port of this developer&#39;s alternate firmware for Mutable Instruments Peaks.</p>

<p>The idea behind Palimpsest is to write sequences gradually, using a pair of trigger signals. One of the triggers (Digital 1) clocks the sequencer. The other trigger (Digital 2) is a &quot;Brush,&quot; which adds a CV value (&quot;Compose&quot;) to the current step. If the sequencer is clocked without a brush trigger having arrived during that step, a CV value (&quot;Decompose&quot;) is <em>subtracted</em> from that step.</p>

<p>The results can be subtle, with a small Compose value and small or zero Decompose value. Or more dramatic shifts can be made, with larger values.</p>

<p>The sequence length can be between 2 and 16 steps. <em>When the cursor is on the Length setting, the sequence is locked, and incoming triggers will not affect it.</em></p>
