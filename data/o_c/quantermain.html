<p>4 channel quantizer, integrates the quantiser from the Mutable Instruments <a href="https://github.com/pichenettes/eurorack/blob/master/braids/quantizer.h">Braids</a> module, but expands it with <strong>interactive scale-edit</strong> functionalities (99 pre-defined scales (editable in the source code - see instructions <a href="http://ornament-and-cri.me/custom-scales/">here</a> - are included, plus 4 fully user-definable scales (with a maximum of 16 notes per octave and additional finetune/microtonal edit options)).</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>for further information re <strong>custom scales, microtonal scales and tunings</strong> see <a href="http://ornament-and-cri.me/custom-scales/">here</a> and <a href="http://ornament-and-cri.me/user-manual-v1_3/#anchor-tunings">here</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>if properly, calibrated, the <strong>output accuracy</strong> should be fairly excellent (is fairly excellent) due to the use of the precision TI 16-bit DAC; the <strong>trigger-to-quantised-output latency</strong> is also very decent: &lt; 100 microseconds.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the four channels are fully independent, but can be slaved to the same clock and/or track the same CV sources, if desired. here’s the default mapping:</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>(†) o_C is very fast, and typically will sample an input voltage just a few tens of microseconds after receiving a trigger signal (in triggered/clocked quantisation mode). If a sequencer or some other stepped voltage source is being sent to the quantiser, then that voltage may still be slewing to its new intended voltage when o_C samples it, or if this source is digital, there may be a few tens of microseconds delay before the voltage source reacts to the trigger signal (assuming it is the same trigger signal that has been sent to o_C) and starts to slew to the new voltage. If this is the case, the <em>Quantermain</em>,  <em>CopierMaschine</em>, <em>Harrington 1200</em>, <em>Automatonnetz</em>, <em>Meta-Q</em>, <em>Sequins</em> or <em>Acid Curds</em>  apps will be sampling and quantising the <strong>previous</strong> sequence (or transposition or root note) step CV, or the may be sampling the CV as it is slewing to the new value. In such cases, increase the <code class="highlighter-rouge">Trigger delay</code> setting until the new CV is reliably sampled after each new trigger/clock signal is received. Note that use of a shorter trigger delay than that required to reliably sample the input CV may result in “wrong notes”, but this may have creative uses, because the wrong notes will still be quantised and constrained to the chosen scale. These considerations only apply when using <em>Quantermain</em> in trigger mode and to the <em>CopierMaschine</em> app, which can only be used with an external trigger) — they do not apply when <code class="highlighter-rouge">Trigger Source</code> is set to <code class="highlighter-rouge">cnt+</code> or <code class="highlighter-rouge">cnt-</code> ( = continuous quantization) in <em>Quantermain</em>.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="method-of-operation">Method of operation</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>When used as a voltage quantiser, for each of the four independent channels, the Quantermain app reads an input voltage from the CV source set for that channel and quantises it to the scale and notes set for that channel, and then applies any post-quantisation transpositions that have been specified. Voltages are read an a new quantised voltage is output when the trigger source specified for that channel fires (rising edge of the trigger, clock or gate signal), unless <code class="highlighter-rouge">Trigger source</code> is set to <code class="highlighter-rouge">cnt+</code> or <code class="highlighter-rouge">cnt-</code>, in which case quantisation is performed continuously on the input voltage. The latency from receipt of a trigger to output of a newly quantised note is under 100 microseconds, and is typically about 50 microseconds. In continuous quantisation mode, the input voltage is read at an effective rate of about 1 kHz, thus quantisation of the input occurs approximately once every millisecond.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When <code class="highlighter-rouge">CV source</code> is set to an input channel <strong>other</strong> than the default/nominal input (e.g. channel #2 is set to <code class="highlighter-rouge">CV source</code> = <code class="highlighter-rouge">CV4</code>), the default input can be re-mapped to a different channel parameter. See <code class="highlighter-rouge">CV aux &gt;</code>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When the <code class="highlighter-rouge">CV source</code> is set to <code class="highlighter-rouge">Turing</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">Lgstc</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">ByteB</code> or <code class="highlighter-rouge">IntSq</code>, instead of reading a voltage on one of the CV inputs (<code class="highlighter-rouge">CV1</code> to <code class="highlighter-rouge">CV4</code>), an internally generated value is used instead (for that channel - you can use the internal sources on some channels and external CV sources on others if you wish). Details of each of these internal sources follow.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: the Turing Machine, Logistic Map, byte beat and integer sequences sources all require external clock inputs to make then step, and thus they do not operate when <code class="highlighter-rouge">Trigger source</code> is set to <code class="highlighter-rouge">cnt+</code> or <code class="highlighter-rouge">cnt-</code>.</p>

<h4 id="the-internal-turing-machine-source">The internal Turing Machine source</h4>

<p>The <code class="highlighter-rouge">Turing</code> source uses a linear-feedback shift register (LFSR) randomly seeded with habit pattern, which is right-shifted by one bit at each clock step (read from the <code class="highlighter-rouge">Trigger source</code> for that channel). There is a settable probability that the least-significant bit is randomly each time the pattern is shifted by one. This arrangement was popularised in modular synthesis as the Richter Noise Ring and the Music Thing Turing Machine. The name of the latter module has been borrowed here (see <a href="http://ornament-and-cri.me/acknowledgements/">acknowledgements</a>).</p>

<h3 id="active-note-scale-mask-and-scale-editing">Active note (scale mask) and scale editing</h3>

<p>To invoke the active note and scale editor, click the right encoder when the <em>Active notes</em> menu option is selected.</p>
<ul>
  <li>turn the left encoder to move the note cursor, click the left encoder to toggle currently selected note on or off</li>
  <li>Up/Down buttons invert the current note mask</li>
  <li>turning the right encoder note-shifts the pattern left or right (= rotate scale mask)</li>
  <li>click the right encoder to exit</li>
</ul>

<p>Using the note editor (user-scales 1-4):</p>
<ul>
  <li>use the right encoder to scroll to the top of the menu, and click the right encoder to select the scale. Choose one of the 4 user-editable scales (<code class="highlighter-rouge">USER1</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">USER2</code>, etc) at the beginning of the list of scales. Click the right encoder again to return to menu scrolling mode.</li>
  <li>Scroll down to <em>Active notes</em> and click the right encoder to invoke the note editor.</li>
  <li>turn the left encoder to move to the note you wish to edit. <strong>Hold down the left encoder, and use the right encoder to edit the pitch value for that note</strong>.</li>
  <li><strong>the length of the scale</strong> can be set by navigating to the final note in the scale, and turning the right encoder to shorten or lengthen the scale. In this way, scales with <strong>4 up to 16 microtonal notes</strong> are possible.</li>
  <li>click the right encoder to exit the note editor</li>
  <li>user-defined scales are saved along with all the other settings, when the save settings procedure is used</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="note">Note</h4>

<p>The user-defined scales only save the note values in a scale - that is, the number of notes in the scale and the pitch value for each of those notes. The user scales don’t save the note masks applied to those scales. Note masks <strong>are</strong> stored when you save settings, but they are not stored with the user-defined scales because note masks also apply to the pre-defined scales.</p>

<p>The user-defined scales were really intended for defining microtonal or non-equally-tempered tunings, where the notes are not spaced 100 cents apart (or at multiples of 100 cents).</p>

<p>However, you can also use the user-defined scales for defining any subset of, say, the “normal” 12-tone equally-tempered (12-TET) chromatic scale. It is a bit fiddly, but doable. In the note mask editor, with a user scale selected, first note down with a pen and paper the pitch values for the 12-TET notes you want in your scale. Note that the values are not in cents, they are in 1/1536 divisions of the octave. Then adjust the number of notes in the user-defined scale using the lozenge at the extreme right of the scale in the editor. Then go to each note in turn in your user-defined scale and adjust the pitch value for it to match the values you wrote down. The notes must be in ascending order! Exit the note mask editor, save you settings and then the user-defined scale should be that subset of notes you just defined. You can still apply note masks on top of that to further subset the notes in the scale if you wish.</p>

<h3 id="continuous-non-triggered-quantisation-modes">Continuous (non-triggered) quantisation modes</h3>

<p>When <code class="highlighter-rouge">Trigger source</code> for a channel is set to <code class="highlighter-rouge">cnt+</code> or <code class="highlighter-rouge">cnt-</code>, quantisation is performed on that channel continuously (well, about 16,667 times per second). In addition, the trigger input which ordinally corresponds to that channel (i.e. TR1 for channel A, TR2 for channel B, TR3 for channel C and TR4 for channel D) can then be used as a gate to transpose the output for that channel up by one octave (if <code class="highlighter-rouge">cnt+</code> is set) or down by one octave if <code class="highlighter-rouge">cnt-</code> is set. In other words, for channel B, if the <code class="highlighter-rouge">Trigger source</code> for it is set to <code class="highlighter-rouge">cnt+</code>, then if TR2 input is high, the output for that channel will be transposed up by one full octave, while the TR2 input remains high. Likewise, if <code class="highlighter-rouge">Trigger source</code> is set to <code class="highlighter-rouge">cnt-</code>, then channel B output will be transposed down one octave while TR2 is held high. Note, however, that the octave transpositions only take effect when there is a note change i.e. when the CV input for that channel has changed sufficiently that it quantises to a new note value. That way, octave transpositions co-incide with note changes, which sounds much better.</p>

<p>Note also that although the trigger inputs used by each channel can be mapped independently, the <code class="highlighter-rouge">cnt+</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">cnt-</code> octave transposition behaviour cannot be mapped - it is hard-coded, so that only TR1 can be used for this purpose for channel A, only TR2 for channel B and so on. Note that TR1 can still also be used as a trigger for any other channel, but not for the <code class="highlighter-rouge">cnt+</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">cnt-</code> octave transposition behaviour on other channels.</p>

<h3 id="screensaver-display-3">Screensaver display</h3>

<p>The screensaver for <em>Quantermain</em> is inspired, possibly on an unconscious level, by the Sick Bay vital signs display in the original <em>Star Trek</em> series.</p>

<p><img src="./ornament &amp; crime_files/P103_6_thelightsofzetar.jpg" alt="Star Trek sick bay" class="img-responsive"></p>

<p>There are four “lanes”, one for each channel. In each lane, short lines representing the quantised pitch (on a semitone scale) scroll leftwards. The small triangles to their right move up and down to indicate the octave for that channel. Triggers (a vertical bar) and input voltages (a horizontal bar, left-going for negative voltages, right-going for positive) are indicated above each channel lane (replaced by a bit-pattern display when the sources are set to LFSR (Turing Machine) or logistic map, rather than external CV).</p>

<h3 id="tips-2">Tips</h3>

<p>You can disable quantisation on each channel by setting the scale to <code class="highlighter-rouge">Off</code>. When in clocked mode (that is, <code class="highlighter-rouge">Trigger source</code> is set to TR1, TR2, TR3 or TR4), then that channel acts as a traditional sample-and-hold (S&amp;H), without any voltage droop, of course. Thus, Quantermain can act as a quad S&amp;H if you want. The only limitation is that the effective maximum sample rate is about 1 kHz, even if the clock/trigger signal you give it is at a higher frequency. This is because the ADCs are only read at an effective rate of about 1 kHz.</p>

<p>Disabling quantisation when using a Turing Machine, Logistic map, byte beats or integer sequence internal source allows the output for that channel to act as a semi-random modulation source.</p>
