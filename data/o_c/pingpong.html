<h3 id="inputs-and-outputs-5">Inputs and outputs</h3>

<p>Trigger inputs and CV1 to CV4 are mappable per-channel via the menu. Outputs for channels A to D appear on outputs A to D respectively.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p><em>Dialectic Ping Pong</em> is a port of the bouncing ball envelope generators from the Mutable Instruments Peaks module source code (these are not exposed in the official Peaks firmware, but are available on Peaks with the <a href="https://github.com/timchurches/Mutated-Mutables/releases">Dead Man’s Catch</a> alternative firmware installed). These generators implement a simple but effective simulation of the physics of a ball that is thrown into the air with a certain velocity, from a certain height, and which then returns to Earth (or a planet of your choice) under the influence of (configurable) gravity, and then bounces (with a settable “bounce loss” simulating how hard the ball is pumped up, if it is a basketball), before being pulled back to Earth and bouncing again, and so on.</p>

<h3 id="screensaver-display-7">Screensaver display</h3>

<p>The screen is divided into quadrants, each showing a rolling display of the output values on each of channels A to D.</p>
