<p><em>Piqued</em> presents quite a rich UI (user interface), which is harder to describe in words than it is to use. The following explanations should make sense as soon as you see the UI in action. Once experienced, the interface becomes quite intuitive, we think.</p>

In addition, the end-of-cycle (EOC) of an envelope in one of the three other channels in <em>Piqued</em> can be specified as a trigger source. Thus, if <code class="highlighter-rouge">Trigger input</code> for channel B is set to <code class="highlighter-rouge">A EOC</code>, then chanel B will trigger as soon as the channel A envelope reaches it’s end-of-cycle. In this way, envelopes across the channels can be chained or sequenced, in potentially complex patterns. By such internal cross-channel triggering of an envelope with a gate shape at the end-of-cycle of another envelope, EOC gate outputs can be emulated.</td>

Available trigger delay modes  are <code class="highlighter-rouge">Off</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">Queue</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">Ring</code>. <code class="highlighter-rouge">Queue</code> means that subsequent triggers received while a delay period is active are added to a queue for later action, up to a maximum queue depth set by the <code class="highlighter-rouge">Tr delay count</code> setting (maximum 32). Further triggers during the delay period are ignored until the number of queued triggers falls below the value set by <code class="highlighter-rouge">Tr delay count</code>. <code class="highlighter-rouge">Ring</code> is similar except that triggers received after the queue is full will replace the final trigger in the queue.</td>

    <tr>
      <td>Euclidean pattern</td>
      <td>is visible if <code class="highlighter-rouge">Eucl length</code> is not set to <code class="highlighter-rouge">off</code>. This displays the currently set Euclidean pattern. The current step is indicated by a small moving dash under the dashed line (one dash per step in the pattern, with the number of steps set by <code class="highlighter-rouge">Eucl length</code>). Pressing the R encoder invokes an “Euclidean editor”. When this editor is displayed, rotating the L encoder sets the fill setting for the pattern, and rotating the R encoder sets the offset or rotation of the patter. Both encoders can be used simultaneously. The fill setting is the number of beats in the pattern that let triggers through to “fire” the envelope. If the fill number is equal to or greater than the Euclidean pattern length number, then every incoming trigger will pass the Euclidean filter and fire the envelope for that channel. If the fill number is zero, then none shall pass, to quote Gandalf. The combination of pattern length (<code class="highlighter-rouge">Eucl length</code>) and number of active beats (the fill setting) within that pattern length uniquely determines the Euclidean pattern, using the Bjorklund algorithm. For example, if <code class="highlighter-rouge">Eucl length</code> is set to 8 and fill is set to 5, and the offset parameter is set to the default of 0, then the pattern will be 10110110, where 1 is an active beat (triggers are allowed to pass) and 0 is inactive (triggers are blocked). By setting offset to 1, the pattern becomes 01101101, if set to 2 the pattern becomes 11011010 and so on - that is, the pattern is rotated.</td>

In general, use a different trigger input for <code class="highlighter-rouge">Eucl reset</code>, and/or set <code class="highlighter-rouge">Eucl reset div</code> to greater than 1, or even better, to a value greater than the length of the Euclidean pattern.</td>

New gate signals reset the loop counter. Note that there is settable CV control over this parameter. This allows these looping envelope modes to become CVable burst generators, with CV control of the number of repetitions in each burst of envelopes, as well as the shape, duration and amplitude of the envelopes that make up the burst.

<p>Trigger input and CV1 to CV4 are mappable per-channel via the menu, as described above. Outputs for envelopes A to D appear on outputs A to D respectively.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>

<p><em>Piqued</em> is a a port of the envelope generator function from the open-source <a href="http://mutable-instruments.net/modules/peaks">Mutable Instruments Peaks</a> module. <em>Piqued</em> provides four independently-triggerable envelopes on output channels A to D, with independently mappable voltage-control via the CV1 to CV4 inputs over envelope duration and/or other parameters for each segment of each envelope. Triggers for each of the four envelopes can also be mapped from any of the four trigger inputs (TR1 to TR4). Segment shape (curves) can be set for each segment of each of the four envelopes. A variety of envelope types are available, also independently settable for each envelope, including repeating (looping) envelope types. The shape of each envelope can be visualised while setting parameters. There is also a “Euclidean trigger filter” included, which turns the <em>Piqued</em> app into a quad-channel Euclidean polyrhythm generator, that can output envelopes, not just gate/trigger signals. See the <a href="http://ornament-and-cri.me/videos/">o_C videos page</a> for some demonstrations of <em>Piqued</em>.</p>

<p>The screen is divided into quadrants, each showing a rolling display of the output values on each of channels A to D. Superimposed on this rolling value line is a representation of the envelope for that channel, as it progresses through its segments.</p>

<ul>
  <li>the ADR mode can also be used as an AHR (attack-hold-release, sometimes also called AHD (attack-hold-decay)) envelope generator. AHR envelope are useful when you want to generate an envelope with a flat sustain period, which usually requires a gate input with some duration. If you only have trigger signals, that is, short pulses, then you can create an AHR envelope by choosing ADR mode, and setting the sustain inflection point to 255 (maximum). By doing that, the decay segment falls from maximum value to… maximum value - in other words, it’s flat! The decay segment time/duration then sets the hold duration after a trigger is received. Also try setting the sustain level in ADR mode to something a little bit less than 255 (say 230), and set the decay shape to Wiggle. Now you have an AHR envelope with a wiggly and slightly downsloping plateau segment. Several variations on this theme are possible.</li>
