By default, with the <code class="highlighter-rouge">Offset</code> setting (see below) at zero, the output range is asymmetric. By reducing the <code class="highlighter-rouge">Output range</code> and then setting a positive <code class="highlighter-rouge">Offset</code>, the output can be shifted so that it is unipolar or otherwise offset at the level desired.</td>

Note that this is an internal offset and the absolute output voltage range is constrained by the hardware to about -3.5V to +6V. Nonetheless, by using it in conjunction with reduced settings of the <code class="highlighter-rouge">Output range</code> parameter, it is possible to make the output entirely unipolar, or even entirely negatively unipolar, if desired. Note that the <code class="highlighter-rouge">Output</code> value is added directly to the value sent to the DAC, and therefore positive or negative offsets (that is, non-zero offsets) without any reduction in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">Output range</code> setting will result in the 16-bit values sent to the DAC overflowing and wrapping around. This will cause waveform deformations, which may be useful or interesting. To remove any such wrap-around deformation, reduce the <code class="highlighter-rouge">Output range</code> setting when using non-zero offsets. If <code class="highlighter-rouge">Output range</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">Offset</code> are left at their defaults of 230 and zero respectively, no waveform deformation will occur.</td>

<p><em>Quadraturia</em> is a port of of the quadrature wavetable LFO that is available as the “Easter egg” in the Mutable Instruments <a href="https://github.com/pichenettes/eurorack/tree/master/frames">Frames</a> module. However, <em>Quadraturia</em> adds voltage control over three of the four LFO parameters (as well as CV control of frequency/rate of the LFO, as in Frames). Because the background ISR of o_C runs at 16.7KHz instead of 32KHz as in Frames, the behaviour of <em>Quadraturia</em> may not be identical to the Frames Easter egg, but it should be very close, and is nonetheless a very useful and flexible source of modulation voltages. For more details of how the Frames Easter egg LFO behaves, see the relevant section of the <a href="http://mutable-instruments.net/modules/frames/manual">Frames Manual</a>.</p>

<p><em>Quadraturia</em> also incorporates the “predictive” tap-tempo capability from the Tap LFO mode in the Mutable Peaks module. Details are given in the <strong>Tap tempo</strong> section below.</p>

<p>Internally, there are four LFOs (LFO1 to LFO4), with LFO2 to 4 running at some ratio of the (master) frequency of LFO1 (by default, that ratio is one, so all the LFOs run at the same frequency). The wave shape, phase of frequency modulation of LFO2 to 4 can be changed, relative to those parameters for LFO1, using the Shape spread, phase/frequency spread and coupling controls (see table below).</p>

<h3 id="tap-tempo-mode">Tap tempo mode</h3>

<p>The “predictive” tap tempo facility used in the Tap LFO mode in the <a href="https://mutable-instruments.net/modules/peaks/">Mutable Peaks</a> module has been added to <em>Quadraturia</em> in v1.3. This allows the period of the LFO waveform output on channel A to be locked to the period of “taps” or pulses (or, in fact, the rising edge of any regular input signal of more than about 1V amplitude) input on TR3. This will synchronise to both regular clock inputs as well as regular rhythms with unequal spacing of the taps. However, it cannot predict the future, and thus it will <strong>not</strong> be able to sync to irregular rhythms or randomly-timed pulses.</p>

<p>The frequency/period of the output on channels B, C and D will be the same as channel A if the frequency ratio setting for those channels is 1.0 (unity). Otherwise, it will be some multiple or division of the channel A frequency. In other words, the frquency ratio settings for channels B, C and D are honoured in <strong>tap tempo</strong> mode as well as in normal mode.</p>

<h3 id="tips-3">Tips</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>To achieve the classic quadrature LFO patch (incremental 90° phase offset on outputs), set the phase/frq spread to +127.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Try mixing the some of the outputs with a DC-coupled mixer (such as the Mutable Instruments Shades or Links modules) in order to create even more complex waveforms.</p>
