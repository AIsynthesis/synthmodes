          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td><b>IN</b></td>
            <td>
              Amplitude and Spectral Centroid envelopes of the EXCITE input are applied to this signal input so that the IN signal mimics the loudness and brightness of the EXCITE input. Sending the same signal to EXCITE and IN allows for gating/expansion. With nothing patched, +3.3v normalled to IN, so sending a signal to EXCITE allows for the envelope follower output to be reproduced at OUT.
