Mobile-friendly cheat sheets for synthesizer modules

This repo powers https://www.synthmodes.com, and the [Modes app for iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/ca/app/modes/id1445358435?mt=8).

# contributing
The cheat sheets are written in HTML with some CSS for styling.  If you want to contribute in that format, that is great.  If you don't have the skills, formatted text or markdown in an issue is a great start.
